Slide: AWS IAM

- Creation and management of user identities (users, groups, and roles) within AWS.
- Each identity can be assigned **access keys** to authenticate to AWS resources.
- Supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.

- Permissions are granted through policies that define what actions are allowed on specific resources.
- IAM roles used to assign permissions.
- Fine grained access control helps implement the principle of least privilege by ensuring users only have the permissions needed for their role.

- IAM integrates with external identity providers (e.g., Microsoft Entra ID, Okta) to enable Single Sign-On (SSO) capabilities.
- Supports both SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) and OIDC (OpenID Connect) for federating access to AWS.
- Reducing the need for separate AWS credentials and improving security with centralized user management.

- AWS IAM enables issuance of temporary security credentials through AWS Security Token Service (STS).
- Ideal for situations requiring short-term access to AWS resources, such as third-party apps or external contractors.
- Temporary credentials are automatically revoked after a set time, reducing the risk of stale access permissions.

-->
## AWS IAM

### Provides Centralized Identity and Access Management

- Identity Management
  - Users, Groups, Roles
- RBAC and Permissions Management
  - IAM Roles, IAM Policies
- Federated Identities
  - SSO, SAML, OIDC
- AWS STS
  - Temporary Credentials and Session Management

---

<!--

Slide AWS IAM Authentication

- Access keys are used to authenticate users or services when interacting with AWS resources via the API, AWS CLI, or SDKs.
- Access Key ID is public
- Secret Access Key is private and must be kept secure.
- Together, they allow programmatic authentication without needing console credentials.
- The Access Key ID and Secret Access Key pair work like a username and password for API calls.
- Example: AWS Credentials File

-->
## Access Keys for Programmatic Authentication

- Access Key ID is public
- Secret Access Key is private
  - Must be kept secure

```bash
[user1]
aws_access_key_id=ASIAI44QH8DHBEXAMPLE
aws_secret_access_key=je7MtGbClwBF/2Zp9Utk/h3yCo8nvbEXAMPLEKEY
```

---

<!--

Slide: DO NOT USE SECRET KEYS

- Long-term access keys can be compromised if exposed or mishandled, leading to persistent security risks.
- Against prescribed AWS security best practices.
- Managing access keys across multiple users, services, and systems becomes complex as environments grow.
- Access keys are harder to track and audit compared to roles with temporary credentials.
- Against corporate, enterprise, or regulatory security policies.
- Access keys are tied to specific IAM users, not roles or fine-grained policies.

-->
## DO NOT USE ACCESS KEYS

- Security risk with long term credentials
- Against security best practices
- Difficult to manage at scale
- Against corporate security policies
- Lack of granular access control

---

<!--

Slide: OIDC

- OIDC is an authentication layer built on top of OAuth 2.0, enabling identity verification using tokens.
- Additionally, these tokens that carry claims (user info) and scopes (permissions).
- This allows fine-grained authorization in apps by controlling what data users can access based on their identity.
- It allows applications to authenticate users via external identity providers (e.g., Google, Microsoft).
- OIDC is commonly used for Single Sign-On (SSO), allowing users to log in once and access multiple apps.
- Reduces the need for separate credentials.
- OIDC provides more secure and scalable user authentication compared to long-term AWS IAM access keys, which are prone to exposure and management overhead.
- OIDC tokens are short-lived and can be dynamically scoped, reducing the risk of stale or overly broad permissions that are common with IAM access keys.

-->
## Better Alternative: Use OIDC

### OIDC enables federated identity management across applications and services

- Provides identity verification using tokens
- Enables fine-grained authorization using claims and scopes
- OIDC tokens are short lived and dynamically scoped
- Enables federated access allowing IdP's to authenticate users for third party apps

---

<!--

Slide: AWS OIDC

- AWS IAM OIDC (OpenID Connect) allows external identity providers (like Google or Microsoft Entra ID) to authenticate users for AWS services.
- It enables federated access, allowing users to sign in using their existing credentials, without needing separate AWS IAM user accounts.
- Supports temporary short-lived credentials
- Ideal for organizations that want to authenticate users from external identity providers like Google, Facebook, or enterprise SSO solutions.
- Useful for scenarios where users need access to AWS resources but should not have IAM user credentials (e.g., external contractors, third-party services).
- Reduces the risk of credential leakage by using short-lived tokens instead of long-term AWS IAM access keys.
- IAM Web Identity Roles allow users to assume AWS roles using tokens from external identity providers (such as OIDC-compatible services like Google, Facebook, or custom enterprise SSO solutions).

-->
## AWS IAM OIDC Provider

- Integration with external OIDC IdP's for authentication to AWS
- Enables federated access and SSO
- Removes need for AWS IAM users and long-lived AWS IAM access keys
- External users assume AWS IAM Web Identity Roles

---

<!--

Slide: ENTRA ID

- Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory) allows organizations to manage users.
- Comprehensive cloud-based IdP
- Provides tools to manage lifecycle of users such as provisioning and deprovisioning, access permissions.
- Governance and security - conditional access policies, MFA, advanced reporting
- Federated access enabling SSO via SAML or OIDC
- Provides ability to register applications and configuring OIDC, enabling obtaining tokens for API access

-->
## Entra ID = Azure based IdP

- Microsoft Azure based IAM solution
- Provides IdP functionality (e.g. user management)
- Application registration for external apps
- Identity governance

---

<!--

Slide: Integrated Solution

- An external application (e.g. CI/CD) is registered in Entra ID.
- An external application logs in with an Azure service principal.
- When a login with the service principal is successful, it authorizes the use of the Azure App Registration and provides the client with a token that specifies the roles, audience, and permissions available to the client in Entra ID.
- The client uses the token obtained from Microsoft Entra ID to exchange it with a temporary token from AWS STS.
- AWS STS generates a temporary token and provides it to the client.
- The client is able to take on the IAM Web Identity Role and gain access to the resources permitted for that role.
- A trust policy within the IAM Web Identity Role authorizes AWS STS to exchange an Entra ID token for an AWS STS token.

-->
## AWS + Entra ID Integrated Solution

![bg fit right](./images/integrated-solution-dark.png)

1. External application is registered in Entra ID
2. Upon login, Entra ID provides a token
3. The client uses the Entra ID token to obtain a temporary token from AWS STS
4. The client assumes the IAM Web Identity Role

Slide 10: Challenges of Manual Setup in Enterprise Environments

- Results in a violation of enterprise security policies and compliance because, when done by different individuals, it will result in varying approaches and setups.
- Needs substantial access privileges in both AWS and the IdP, potentially leading to significant security risks.
- Requires a deep understanding of both platforms, a competence that can be lacking in many companies.


-->
## Challenges of Manual Setup in Enterprise Environments

- Violation of enterprise security policies
- Requires elevated privileges in both AWS and Entra ID
- Requires deep understanding of both platforms (AWS IAM and Entra ID)
- Different individuals use varying approaches and setups
- Manual configurations are error prone

Slide: Need for automation at scale

- Enterprise organizations multiple AWS accounts for various purposes (e.g. Logging, Networking, Security).
- Additionally, various business units may have many AWS Accounts.
- Environments (e.g. DEV, TEST, PROD) are often broken up into different AWS accounts.
- Many organizations uses AWS Control Tower, AWS Landing Zone Accelerator (LZA) or other automation pipelines to programmatically create AWS accounts at scale.
- In these scenarios, automation can create AWS IAM OIDC Provider in each account.

Slide: Solution overview

- Process starts with creation or deletion of an IAM Web Identity Role in one of the newly created member accounts.
- AWS CloudTrail records the event.
- Event Rule captures these specific events and sends them to an Event Bus
- In the OIDC Factory Account, we also have an event rule
- Event rule triggers a Lambda Function that then invokes one of two Step Function workflows.

Slide: Solution Components - Creation of IAM Web Identity Role

- **Create Service Principal Lambda**
  - Function calls a Entra ID API to register a new application. The Lambda function returns a unique audience identifier for the Entra ID application.

- **Add Audience to OIDC Provider Lambda**
  - Function receives an audience identifier. It adds the audience identifier to the pre-deployed IAM OIDC Provider in the newly-created AWS account.

- **Assign Role to Audience Lambda**
  - Function updates the trust relationship in the IAM Web Identity Role by adding the audience identifier of the application registration to allow the newly-created service principal to assume the Web Identity Role.
  - This step is required because, unlike a manual setup, the AWS user does not have an audience identifier so users enter any dummy value which will be overwritten few seconds afterwards.
